A routine customs inspection was performed on a package that was sent by a person named Pieter Dopple, 22 Hoveniersstraat, Antwerp, Belgium. This package was addressed to A. Hijazi, 1212 Lyons Ave., Newark, NJ. The customs form stated that this package contained two decorative clocks having a commercial value of $250.00. The package instead contained 111 polished diamonds, whose value is estimated to be $47,000. Discussions with the FBI resulted in a decision not to pursue a customs violation charge against HIjazi. The reason is that HIjazi is currently under FBI surveillance. This package was resealed and delivered to HIjazi by USPS..
