A tip from an anonymous source directed investigators to a residence at 2111 Troost Ave. in Kansas City, Missouri. This source said that explosives were being manufactured at this residence by some terrorists who intended to blow up several buildings in the Kansas City Area. A warrant was obtained to search this residence on evidence provided by an examination of items found in garbage sacks that were picked up by an FBI officer posing as a garbage collector. Traces of chemicals necessary to produce explosives were found on items in this garbage. When this residence was searched on 22 December, 2003, one man, who gave his name as Walter Smith, was the only person at home. While the investigation was proceeding, another man entered and was apprehended. Subsequent identity checks revealed this man to be Jamal al Quso, who had come from Chicago to Kansas City. What was found at this residence were batches of hexamethylene triperoxide diamine [HMTD] and cyclotrimethylene trinitramine [RDX], both primary explosives. Also found were three garbage sacks full of urea and aluminum sulfate. In later investigations of this residence, detailed drawings were found of three popular casinos in the Kansas City area: the Argosy Riverside Casino, the Isle of Capri Casino, and Harrah's Casino..
