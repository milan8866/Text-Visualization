Information was requested of Belgian intelligence by the FBI on 1 September about Pieter Dopple, who lives at 22 Hoveniersstraat, Antwerp, Belgium. He sent the diamonds to Adnan Hijazi as noted in the USCBP report of 12 July, 2004. Belgian intelligence reports that Dopple has been under surveillance as a fence for diamonds obtained by groups, many of them associated with Islamic ventures, in various places in Africa. It appears that Dopple receives raw diamonds and other precious stones such as tanzanite and cuts and polishes them for distribution. Dopple receives a fee for his services but does not sell the stones himself. He sends them where his suppliers specify. At his interrogation, Dopple admitted that he was part of a scheme for transferring funds for militant Islamic groups and agreed to cooperate with investigators. He listed several persons in addition to Hijazi to whom he had sent polished diamonds and tanzanite. One person he named was Ramundo Ortiz, who runs a business in Panama City, Panama. He further said that he had just sent about $150,000 in polished diamonds to Ortiz on 25 September. Asked for the identity of the person(s) who had requested this transaction, he could only say that they were from Peshawar in Pakistan..
