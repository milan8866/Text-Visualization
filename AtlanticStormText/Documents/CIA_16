Based on the NSA report of 1 July, 2003, information was solicited from RCMP regarding the activities of an R. Derwish who lives at 811 Tecumseh Rd. in Windsor, Ontario. The RCMP report that this person's name is in fact Satam Derwish, a Saudi who has used the first name Ronald since he arrived in Canada in 1992. Derwish now holds a Canadian passport. Derwish has been under surveillance recently by the RCMP because of his associations with suspected Hezbollah members in Windsor and in Detroit, Michigan. Derwish works as a ticket agent for Canada Eastern Airlines in Windsor. He gets frequent trips at low cost to various places in the USA and has traveled recently to Newark, NJ, Chicago, IL, and Columbus, Ohio, all of which are cities served by Canadian Eastern Airlines..
