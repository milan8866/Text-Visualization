On 29 October, 2004 investigators went to the offices of the American Islamic Scholarship Fund located at 1721 Glade Dr. in Reston VA. There they interviewed the director of this fund, a man named Abdul Karim. Karim led the initial discussion and described how many deserving students of Islamic descent had been assisted by this scholarship fund since it was begun in 1991. Karim was first asked if this Fund did indeed receive the $48,000 scholarship donation made by a man named Adnan Hijazi on 14 September, 2004. Checking his records, Karim verified the receipt of this donation by Karim. Then Karim was asked for the names of persons who received money from this donation from Hijazi. Karim hesitated at first and then said: "Every now and then we receive money from donors who identify the students to whom the scholarship money should go. This happened in the case of Hijazi's donation." Checking his records again, Karim said: "HIjazi stipulated that $8,000 should go to each one of the following students: Wali Shakur, 224 Paulson Ave. CLifton, NJ; Hamza al Midhar, 1641 Pitkin Ave. Brooklyn, NY; Mounir Mzoudi, 2116 27th St. Laurel, MD; Mamoun Zammar, 1621 Charles Ave., Potomac, MD; Said Khadr, 6132 Broward Blvd., Fort Lauderdale, FL; Muhammed Dandani, 455 11th St., Miami Beach, FL." Karim then said that these amounts of money were sent to each of these persons on 17 September, 2004. Finally, Karim was asked if Hijazi had made any other donations to this fund in the past. Karim said that his recollection was that Hijazi had contributed to the scholarship fund on two other occasions, once in 1999 and once in 2001..
