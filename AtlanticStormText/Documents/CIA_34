A source in Moscow who happens to work under the direction of Pyotr Safrygin at Central Russia Airlines says he drove Safrygin to a location near Strizhi on 1 September where Safrygin met a man in a farm house. The source says Safrygin gave the man a bag, probably containing rubles, and received a package about the size of four shoeboxes that was marked [in Russian] "antibiotics". On the way back to Moscow, the source said Safrygin told him that these antibiotics were to be sold on the black market in Africa..
