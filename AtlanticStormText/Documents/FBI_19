Further information regarding Saeed al Nami and and Riyad al Taifi who were apprehended on 26 December, 2003 during a robbery attempt in Arlington, Texas [see FBI report 2 January, 2004]. Both of these individuals are Saudis who came to Buenos Aires, Argentina in January of 2001. They are both wanted by the police in Buenos Aires for their role in the bombing of a Jewish synagogue in Buenos Aires in April of 2002. Escaping apprehension, they went to Calamar, Columbia in May, 2002, where they are now known to have been active in collaborating with the ELN. In January, 2003 they came to the USA following a route taken by other Islamic militants known to have come into the USA. This route took them from Calamar to Cartagena in Columbia and then by boat to Guane in Cuba. They then went by boat from Guane, Cuba to Chetumal, Mexico. From Chetumal they traveled to Mexico City and then on to the border town of Ojinaga, where they were smuggled into Presidio, Texas. In Ojinaga they were both supplied with Texas driver's licenses and U.S. currency by a person whose name they said they could not remember. They went by bus to Ft. Stockton, San Antonio, and then on to the Dallas area. A search of their apartment at 2727 Robinson Rd. in Grand Prairie, Texas revealed an assortment of automatic weapons and the addresses of two men known to be associated with God's Aryan Militia in Texas. These men are Billy Jack Hawkins, 1212 Pipeline Rd., Euless, Texas, and Slade Goodman of 899 Almeda-Genoa Rd. in Houston, Texas..
