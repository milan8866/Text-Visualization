In identifying the presence of possible Hezbollah members in the Charlotte NC area, the name Rifai Qasim, has recently surfaced. An Egyptian passport in the name of Rifai Qasim was found recently on the floor of the Southern Trailways bus depot in Charlotte, NC. Examined by the Charlotte police, the picture on this passport matches the appearance of a person using the name Omar Blakely, who was charged with the theft, on 1 October, 2003, of several items [total value: $3000] from an electronics supply store in Charlotte. Blakely gave his address as: 3131 Western Ave. in Charlotte. Blakely is now out on bail that was guaranteed by a bail bond company named BailOut, in Charlotte, NC. The $2,000 that this bond cost was paid by a check written on an account at the Carolina First Bank held jointly in the names: Omar Blakely and Muhammed Mustafa. Bank records reveal periodic deposits to this account, usually in the amount of $3000, from an account at the First Emirate Bank in Dubai, UAE. The Carolina First Bank account in the name of Blakely and Mustafa was closed on 23 October, 2003 and the house at 3131 Western Ave is now unoccupied. However, a search through this abandoned house revealed the envelopes of several letters addressed to Rifai Qasim..
