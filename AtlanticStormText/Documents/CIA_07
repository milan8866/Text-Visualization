On 2 April, 2003 the Surete' de l'Etat issued a bulletin concerning a Moroccan named Abdillah Zinedine [alias: Abu Hafs] who had, among others, been occupying a house at 73 Rue Duhesme. Zinedine had been wanted in connection with an attempt to blow up (faire sauter) the Amercan Embassy in Paris in the Fall of 2001. Zinedine is an explosives expert who was in Afghanistan from 1997 - 2000 and who provided Al Qaeda members with explosives training at the Al Badr II training camp in the Pakhtia province area of Afghanistan. It has recently been learned that Zinedine left Paris on a flight to Montreal, Canada on 1 April, 2003. He was using a fraudulent French passport in the name Mehdi Rafiki. Another occupant of the house at 73 Rue Duhesme, on interrogation, reported that Abu Hafs, as he knew Zinedine, said he was on his way to Chicago to visit an old friend whom he only identified as Murad. This source, identified as another Moroccan Zakarya Ziyad, said that Zinedine had mentioned that he and Murad would be doing "great things" in several cities in America..
