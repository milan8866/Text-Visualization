Jamal al Shibh, of Yemeni origin, has been the Imam at the Tawhid Mosque in Miami, Florida for the past ten years. As a result of recent reports provided by informants about al Shibh's call for jihad in America, he has been under surveillance. He was photographed on 2 February, 2004, on the University of Miami campus in Coral Gables, distributing literature, written in Arabic, at various locations known to be frequented by Islamic students. This literature describes how well the city of Miami illustrates that America has become a sink of vice and corruption. Examples are provided of the easy availability of sex and drugs in the Miami area. This literature also calls for immediate jihadic action in order to prevent the corruption of Muslims in America. Especially singled out in this literature is the tourist industry in the Miami area..
