Ahmed Doha and Abu Ayyash are both registered as graduate students at the University of Missouri in Columbia, MO. Both Doha and Ayyash have Saudi student visas issued in July, 2001. Doha was charged with filing a fraudulent insurance claim. On 10 October, 2003 Doha filed a claim with Ayyash's insurance company, Central Farmers Auto Insurance Co., for a back injury he said he suffered on 12 September, 2003 when his car was struck from behind by one driven by Ayyash. Doha's insurance company is the Mid States Insurance Company. Both the Mid States and Central Farmers representatives who subsequently investigated the accident and who handled this claim both stated that Doha and Ayyash said they did not know each other. Doha was paid $11,000 in settlement of this claim on 1 November, 2003 by Central Farmer's Insurance Company. A check of the records at Mid States and Central Farmers insurance companies reveals that both Doha and Ayyash paid for their auto insurance policies from the same account at the Columbia First State Bank. On a valid search warrant, Doha's apartment at 231 12th St. in Columbia was searched on 20 November, 2003 and it was discovered that Ayyash also lives in this apartment. A Dell laptop computer at this residence was taken by the police. Also taken were CDs containing a 7,000 page version of the Encyclopedia of Jihad. The computer, when examined, revealed e-mail messages to and from over 100 addresses in the USA. Many of these messages seemed to involve only personal and academic matters. But one message that attracted attention was sent on 3 November, 2003 to an AOL address for a person identified as wshakur. This message read: "4,000 you requested sent by wire today." This e-mail address belongs to Wali Shakur, who lives at 224 Paulson Ave. in Clifton, NJ. Both Hamas and Al Qaeda are known to have a presence in Columbia, MO. An investigation continues regarding the possible association of Doha and Ayyash with these groups..
