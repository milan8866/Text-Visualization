In response to our query about other associates of Omar Mahmoud Othman at the Baker St. Mosque in London, MI 5 responded with information that a man named Omar Hanif had been given employment by Othman at this mosque in the period 1993 - 1998. He left the UK for a year in 1999 and was possibly in Afghanistan. Travel records show that he traveled from London Heathrow to Islamabad in February of 1999 and returned to London from there in December, 1999. Hanif holds a valid British passport and now lives at #11 Apple St. in Nassau, The Bahamas. He is employed by a chain of hotels in the Bahamas and works at the Seashore Hotel in Nassau and, occasionally, at the Freeport Star Hotel in Freeport. Another name mentioned by MI 5 to be associated with Othman was Jamal al Quso, who came to the UK from Yemen in 1993. He applied for British citizenship in 1998 but was refused because of his repeated troubles with the law. He was convicted of inciting to riot in 1996 and served a one-year suspended sentence. Records reveal that he left London Heathrow on a flight to Chicago, Illinois on July 17, 1999..
