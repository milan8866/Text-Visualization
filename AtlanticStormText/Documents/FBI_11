In response to a request, the FBI searched its files for information on subjects having the initials J. T. [in Detroit, MI], A. H. [in Newark, NJ], and M. M. [in Laurel, MD]. Eight persons with initials J.T. were discovered in Detroit, but all these persons are known to the police and have no interesting information in their files. One person was identified with the initials A. H. in Newark; his name is Adnan Hijazi. Hijazi had been interviewed by the FBI following the 9/11/01 attacks. He was cleared of any association with these events and presently has no other entries on his record. There are just two persons in FBI files for Laurel, MD with initials M. M. One is Martha Mason and her file reveals that she was convicted on 21 January, 2002 for the distribution of narcotics; she is now incarcerated. The other is Mounir Mzoudi, of Moroccan descent, who holds a degree from Baltimore City College, which he obtained in 1994. Mzoudi currently lives at 2116 27th St. in Laurel, MD. Mzoudi recently attracted the attention of the FBI because, according to a source in Baltimore, Mzoudi had a past association with an organization called the Islamic Circle of North America [ICNA]. He attended a meeting of ICNA held in Baltimore from June 20 to July 2, 2000. ICNA quite openly supported the Taliban at this time..
