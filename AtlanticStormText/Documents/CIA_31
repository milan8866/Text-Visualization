It is believed Bugarov worked on aerosolized forms of India-1 smallpox and pneumonic plague. More recent sources say that Bugarov went to Cuba but then returned to Moscow sometime in 1992. He is reported to have divorced his wife in 1993 and has returned to Cuba. However, he still travels frequently to Europe, the Middle East and in South America.
