A number of bombings were attempted in Casablanca on 16 May, 2003. Of five attempts only one succeeded in causing mass casualties. In four of the attempts that failed only the bombers were killed. These bombings are believed to have been the actions of local individuals who may have been trained by Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. A person believed to have been a participant in the successful bombing was apprehended on 18 June, 2003; his name is Mohamed Essabar. On interrogation, Essabar was asked to reveal the names of other participants, which, even under duress, he refused to do. However, when he was arrested he was carrying a note in Arabic signed by a person named A. Atmani. One person of interest having this name is Abdellah Atmani, who has been a resident of Casablanca all his life. During interviews with Atmani, it became clear that he had no part in the bombings on 16 May, 2003. However, his name was brought to our attention because Atmani works as a loading supervisor for the Holland Orange Shipping Lines that has offices and docks in Casablanca. Holland Orange ships make regular freight runs from Casablanca to a variety of locations along the east coast of the USA as well as to places in the Caribbean. Moroccan police reported that they were keeping Atmani under surveillance..
