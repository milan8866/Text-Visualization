On 1 November, 2003 Mousa Salah, of no fixed address in Herndon, VA., was arrested at Dulles International Airport as he attempted to board a flight to London Heathrow. At the time of his arrest he was using a Jordanian passport in the name Shadi abu Hoshar. Salah has been wanted in connection with Hamas fund-raising and other activities in Northern Virginia. It is believed that Salah entered the USA illegally from Windsor, Canada into Detroit, MI in 2002. Salah was in possession of a Virginia driver's license # T21-23-8820 registered in the name Mousa Salah. Virginia DOT records show that this same license number was issued on 10 August, 2001 to a woman named April Stevens of Roanoke, VA. Ms Stevens is not the subject of further investigations; she teaches kindergarten classes in Roanoke. The address shown on Salah's driver's license does not exist. Several numbers and initials were written on the back of an envelope in possession of Salah at the time of his arrest; they are: (i) J. T., Detroit, (ii) A. H., Newark, (iii) M. M., Laurel..
