Intercepted phone call on 28 November, 2004 from Havana, Cuba to Moscow, Russia. The call originated from an office at a Cuban Government building at 222 Fidel St. in Havana. The call was received at an office of Central Russia Airlines in Moscow. The caller says [in Russian]: "Hello Pyotr, Boris here. I am thinking of coming home in January, will I see you?" The receiver of the call says: "I'll be gone all of January, sorry. By the way, how did you do with the Arab in Casablanca?" The caller says: "Quite well, I sold him four canisters of L-one." The receiver says: "I wasn't supposed to tell you, but I sold him two of N-one. I wonder what they will do with this stuff?" The caller says: "The Arab told me that they would use it in the Middle East, possibly against American forces in Iraq. My guess is that they will use it against the Israelis. I will tell you more about it when we meet. I just bought a new house on the beach. You ought to come for a visit; you can meet my new wife."..
