On 1 December, 2004 this office received in the mail a letter signed "Ramon". This letter was mailed from a post office at Gulfgate in Houston but carried no return address. The letter said that a stain of Type A foot and mouth disease was now in Texas and that cattlemen around Victoria, TX would be the first to suffer. The note also said that members of FARC had traveled from Cartagena, Columbia to Guane, Cuba, to Chetumal, Mexico, to Piedras Negras, Mexico, and then to Victoria, TX..
