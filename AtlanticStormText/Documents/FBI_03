In response to the CIA report [29 June, 2003] regarding Abu Somad, 235 Buckthorn St, Inglewood CA, and Yazid Bafaba, 773 Flaxton St., Culver City, CA., investigators visited these two persons at their residences. Both Somad and Bafaba said they had never heard of persons named Riduan Sungkar or Omar Evertts. Each of Somad and Bafaba was asked if they knew the other and they replied that they did not.
