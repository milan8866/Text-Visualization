On 26 December, 2003 two men were arrested during a robbery attempt at the FirstTex Bank at 435 Fielder Rd. in Arlington, Texas. The two men, both wearing ski masks, were apprehended by Arlington police as they fled from the bank. The men were identified as Saeed al Nami and Riyad al Taifi, both living at 2727 Robinson Rd, Apartment 6, in Grand Prairie, Texas. Each one had a Texas driver's license that was forged, and neither could produce a passport of any kind. They both said they had entered the USA from Mexico at Presidio, Texas and had come to Mexico by way of Central America from Columbia. Both spoke perfect English and were unemployed at the time. An investigation of their residence revealed money in bags identified as belonging to several other banks in the Dallas area. The total amount in the bags amounted to $42,010. In addition, there were small arms of various sorts and literature concerning jihad activities. They rented this apartment from a woman named Ruth Tucker, who said that they had lived in this apartment for three months, had never caused any trouble, and paid their rent on time. She also said that they had told her they were students at the University of Texas in Arlington. One item of mail was discovered in their apartment; it was a letter written in Arabic from a person named A. Doman who gave a return address on the envelope as 231 12th St. in Columbia, MO..
