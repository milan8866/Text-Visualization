A case officer who is at the American embassy in Riyadh says he overheard a conversation at an embassy party between the Spanish ambassador to Saudi Arabia and an American consular official regarding the employment of Saudis in foreign embassies. During this conversation the Spanish ambassador mentioned that an entire family, of the name al Ghamdi, had worked at the Spanish embassy in Riyadh from 1970 to 1988. The ambassador went on to say that he had worked at this embassy as a clerk during this time and had become attached to the three al Ghamdi sons. He added with regret that all three of the boys, whom he had watched grow up, left Saudi Arabia and that two of them had been killed fighting for Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The third son, he added, never returned to Saudi Arabia and the last he heard was that he had taken up residence in Santo Domingo and was now a cab driver..
