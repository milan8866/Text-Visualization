This report concerns results of an FBI interview of the two men apprehended in Carrizo Springs, TX on 3 August, 2004 [See USCBP Report for 11 August, 2004]. Both men spoke perfect English and were very cordial. But they refused to answer any questions and asked to be represented by an attorney. They were fingerprinted and held in custody. Further examination of documents in their possession when they were apprehended revealed a letter, written in Arabic, from a person named Abdul Nasser. This letter was addressed to a person named Ali al-Omari. This letter simply said: "Go forth with Allah's blessing. You have been my best student." Investigation of these two men continues..
