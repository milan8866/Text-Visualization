On 3 December, 2004 this office received a letter from a person who signed his name "Juan". This letter, having no return address, was mailed from a post office in Farmers Branch, TX. Like the letter sent to the Houston field office, this one said that a Type A strain of foot and mouth disease was brought into the USA by persons who had traveled from Cartagena, Columbia, to Guane, Cuba, to Ciudad Madero, Mexico, to Ciudad Acuna, Mexico, and then on to Victoria, TX. The letter closed by saying that this strain of FMD was a "little greeting" from FARC and the ELN..
