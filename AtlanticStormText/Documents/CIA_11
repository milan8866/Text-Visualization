A house at #88 Sahibzada Gul Rd. in Peshawar, suspected of being an Al Qaeda safe house, was raided on 15 May, 2003 by Pakistani Intelligence. Unfortunately, apparently being tipped-off, the occupants had fled the day before. However, in the mess they left behind, there were a few items of interest. One was an expired Pakistani passport issued to a person named Yasir Salman. Other items included a doctor's stethoscope; notes taken in Arabic on Legionella and gastroenteritis; and notes, written in Arabic, about the results of a May, 2002 project in the USA called TOPOFF I. In addition, an opened envelope addressed in Arabic to F. Badawi was found behind a cabinet in one of the rooms in this house. Finally, a note written in Arabic simply stated: "Karachi, March 10, 2003, Safrygin, funds."..
