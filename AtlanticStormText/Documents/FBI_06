Regarding Jamal al Quso, who was said by MI 5 to have come from London to Chicago in 1999 [see CIA report for 16 May, 2003], the Chicago FBI field office responded by reporting that a Jamal al Quso had landed at O'Hare Airport on July 18, 1999 using a British passport in his name. A check with USCIS reveals no evidence that he ever left the USA since his arrival. In addition, the name Jamal al Quso has been associated by an informant with Islamic Jihad, which is known to have a presence in Chicago. On 28 September, 2003 a house at 2211 Cermak Rd. in Chicago, said by the informer to be occupied by members of Islamic Jihad, was raided by an FBI team acting under a warrant. One person, Abdul Murad, was the only person at this residence at the time of the raid. Thirty kilos, of C-4 plastic explosives were found at this residence along with an additional 25 kilos of Semtex. Maps of O'Hare Airport and diagrams of the Sears Tower were also confiscated. Murad, now being held, has refused to say who the other occupants of this residence are. However, on a notepad found in the room Quso possibly occupied at this residence was listed the message [in Arabic]: "Jamal, call Khalid S., Texas, tomorrow for sure." Jamal al Quso's present location is not known..
