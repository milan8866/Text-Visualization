Based on a NSA intercept reported on 12 September, 2003, information was requested about a person named Bugarov, presumably Russian, who might have had contact with Pyotr Safrygin at the Vector Institute in Moscow. It is believed that a Boris Bugarov worked as a scientist on bioweapons at Vector between the years 1986 and 1990. In 1990 he traveled to Havana, Cuba with a Maj. Gen. Yury Kalinin, but returned to Moscow shortly thereafter. He has not been seen since then; but sources in Russia say he has returned to Cuba and now lives in Havana where he works in some capacity for the Cuban government..
