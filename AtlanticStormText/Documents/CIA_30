Sources tracking Cesar Arze in Santo Domingo report that, on 1 May, 2004, Arze was photographed at a park in Santo Domingo in company with Carlos Morales and a man now identified as a Cuban named Jose Escalante. It is now known that Arze and Escalante received training together in 1992 - 1993 at a school for medical technicians in Havana, Cuba. Arze has been suspected of associations with Cuban intelligence [See CIA Report 22 February, 2003]. Additional information is now available on Carlos Morales, who was overheard speaking fluent Arabic [see CIA Report 15 November, 2003]. Our sources in Buenos Aires, Argentina report that there is a considerable traffic in forged birth certificates among members of the Islamic community in Argentina..
