Agents tracking domestic websites noted an item posted on a website called "Government Secrets". This website posts information that its sources claim are items of information being kept from the public by the US government. The sources are never identified on the website. On 6 December, 2004 was posted the following item:"We are always told how secure are the germ labs and storage areas are on Plum Island, just off Long Island. This is total BS. We know that fake IDs to get on Plum Island are not hard to get. And, we also know that, on 1 December, 2004, samples of a strain of foot and mouth disease was quite easily stolen from Lab 101 on Plum Island. How long is our government going to keep us in the dark about the lack of security on Plum Island. The safety of our food supply is at stake."..
