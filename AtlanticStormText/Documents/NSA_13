The caller began by saying [in Spanish]: "As you have heard, our Arab friends need to find a new way north. We hear that Chetumal may not be good any more. Can you recommend another stopover?" The recipient of the call replies: "Yes, we have given this some thought and recommend you try Ciudad Madero. We are close by and can provide help. This will also make the route to Ojinaga shorter. Will we have access to the same funds?" The reply was "Yes, of course. This sounds very good."..
