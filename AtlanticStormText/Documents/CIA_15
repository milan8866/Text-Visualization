A Pakistani citizen volunteered on 15 July, 2003, for a price, to provide information about what happened to the former occupants of #88 Sahibzada Gul Rd. in Peshawar. All he could say is that he knew they went north, most likely to Chitral. Asked to provide more information about the previous occupants, all he would say is that he knew they were Al Qaeda. A footnote to this story is that, on 17 July, this informer was found with his throat slit in a back alley in Peshawar..
