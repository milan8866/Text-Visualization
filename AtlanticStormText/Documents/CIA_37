In the CIA Report for 13 February, 2004 it was noted that Pakistani intelligence had agreed to keep a residence at 631 Nishtar Rd. in Karachi under surveillance. On 17 September, 2004 they reported to us that events had prompted a raid on this residence on 5 September, 2004. During this raid five persons were killed, among them two police officers. The three others killed were identified as: Abdul Jabarah [a Kuwaiti], Fahd Jehani [a Saudi], and Ramzi al Shibh [a Yemeni], all of whom are known members of Al Qaeda. Jehani seems to have been a courier since he was carrying a packet of messages. Most of the messages contained instructions for insurgent activities in Pakistan, including an attempt to be made on 1 October, 2004 to destroy police HQ in Karachi. But one message was addressed to S. H in Chitral that read; "Allah, all praise to him, has provided the funds you need to finish your work. These funds will be on their way in ten days." This message was sent by a person only identified as Moataz [possibly an alias] and was sent from Gwadar, Pakistan..
