He was then asked if he had corresponded with anyone in Marrakech, Morocco; he replied that he had never done so. Then he was asked if he had ever met or had any dealings with a person named Khaled Jehani [see DIA Report: 5 March, 2004]. al Nami replied that he had never heard of this person. Asked what the nature of his work was at Detroit Utilities Co. and how it involved the SCADA systems, al Nami replied that it was his job to make sure that his company made full use of the operational characteristics of these control and data acquisition systems. Asked if he ever accessed these systems from his home, al Nami replied that the demands of his job required that he do lots of work at home at nights and on weekends. Asked if he had ever heard about a project called "Black Ice", he said he had not.

Among the items found at his residence was a document describing the results of the "Black Ice" project that was designed to assess the various vulnerabilities associated with the SCADA systems.
