Among the persons under surveillance for possible Al Qaeda associations in the USA is Khalid Shamrani, a Saudi national who lives and works in Houston, Texas for the TexEast Petroleum Co. Shamrani has held a work visa since April, 2000. Suspicion first fell on Shamrani as a result of his attendance at a meeting of God's Aryan Militia in Denton, Texas on 12 March, 2003. He attended another meeting of this militia group in Mineral Wells, Texas on 16 June, 2003. An FBI informant who attends the meetings of this militia group developed a friendship with Shamrani and was invited to his home at 3236 Pine St. in Bellaire, Texas. The informant says he there saw elaborate diagrams of the Houston Ship Channel and detailed plans for Reliant Stadium and the Galleria Shopping Mall in Houston. The informant also said that Shamrani revealed his association with an Islamic group that had many of the same objectives as God's Aryan Militia including the elimination of Zioni st influence on the US government. The informant also reported that Shamrani said there would be "big events" in Houston, Chicago and in other places during the next year, but he did not elaborate on the nature of these events..
